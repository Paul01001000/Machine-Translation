# Machine Translation
This is the result of a university project of the lecture Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. 
The code features a section about the preprocessing of the the training and testing data. Followed by two approaches the create a Machine Translation Modell using LSTM. The first approach on the character level, while the second approach is on a word level and therefore giving more semantic context leading to slightly better results and better performance.
Both approaches use the keras library in Python.
